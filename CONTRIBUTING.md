# Contributing to VULKN

We welcome any positive and dedicated contributors to help develop Vulkn and enrich the ClickHouse
landscape with amazing DataOps, DevOps and data management tools.

You don't have to be a full-time programmer to contribute. We welcome documentation updates, 
suggestions and feature requests as well.

## Contributor License Agreement (CLA)

CLAs and CAAs (Copyright Assignment Agreements) are commonly used to protect both the 
developer/contributor and the original copyright owner (VulknData in this case). They are used to 
simplify protection of the work as a whole and enable relicensing of the work or part thereof under
Open Source, free or for-profit commercial multi-licensing programmes. This has been used to great
success by MySQL, MongoDB, Qt and many others to provide a means for sustainable Open Source 
development and ensure developer contributions are forever protected and available.

Example - for ClickHouse; [Yandex require a CLA](https://github.com/ClickHouse/ClickHouse/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
that enables Yandex to use contributions both commercially and Open Source. This is a reasonable 
expectation and provides for sustainable development with legal provisions and protections for both 
Yandex and the contributing developer under the Apache License and the Yandex CLA.

Like the Linux kernel, Vulkn is released under the GPL (v3 specifically) - and the Free Software 
Foundation [recommends](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/why-assign.en.html) managed contribution 
copyright through donation of the copyrighted work to the FSF or management of copyrighted works by 
the originating entity.
