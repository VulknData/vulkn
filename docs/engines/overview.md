# Data Storage / Engines

Engines are used to store data in either disk or memory in tabular form. ClickHouse supports over 25
different table engines ranging from Memory, Log and MergeTree structures to Kafka, Hash Joins, Sets
and key/value dictionaries.

Vulkn provides rudimentary support for the most popular engine types.

!!! note
    Support for all engine types is planned in future release.
